The data was given by "The Spark Foundation".

Data include following columns:

- Hours (No. of study hours)
- Scores (Student scores in exam)

## EDA

In this EDA part I visualized training data and test data.


## Simple Linear Regression

Simple Linear Regression was trained.

Simple Linear Regression Formula : y = b0 + b1x1

Therefore, The equation of our simple linear regression model is 
Scores = intercept + (coefficient * Number of Study Hours)
## Conclusion
If a student studying 9.25 hours, then he/she will get [93.69173249] marks
